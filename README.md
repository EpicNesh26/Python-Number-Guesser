# Python-Number-Guesser
The Objective of this Python - Number Guesser is to ask the user a number and the computer picks a random number from the given range and tells the user the amount of tries it took to guess the number!
<br>
The main Idea of this Python Project is to create a number guessing game using the random module !."We import a random number and ask the user to guess the number and tell them if they were above or below the guessed number" And Show how many tries it took for the user to guess the number!
<br>
This project helps in understanding of the "Random" Module with conditional statements. 
<br>
#Project Prerequisties
To Implement the python number guessing project ,we use random module to generate a set of number and allow the user to guess the number and if-else statement to prvide certain conditions
1)Random Module : To generate a set of numbers and allow the user to guess it 
2)Conditional statements : To provide certain conditions to the random number
